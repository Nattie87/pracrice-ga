# Edited code testing (notes in the code also)

> Note: As discussed on the phone, please excuse my terrible spelling.

## Approach
The approach first and foremost was to read what was being asked of me. Have the challenge bullet points in front of me and take things step by step.

The first thing was to define all of my variables eg the DOM elements and the widget values. I then looked at pulling a random event out of an array every second.

Depending on the event, I updated the widget values and updated the DOM accordingly. I added conditions in a switch statement to prevent coffee and fridge items going below zero(nightmare).

In terms of the scoring system I decided to give each widget a score out of 4 and average them which allowed me to pick the mood out of the array.

**Note:** The emoji for lightning and umbrella with rain do not show in the DOM in Chrome(for me) but they do show in the element tab (I promise it's working).

I attempted to namespace throughout and tried to keep my code modular.

If I had more time I would of randomized the timing of the events as opposed to every second.
